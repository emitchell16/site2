  <p>
    I am a researcher in the fourth year of my PhD in Health Services Research and Health Policy with a concentration in Health Economics at Emory University Rollins School of Public Health.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am interested in the accessibility of prescription drugs and other medical products, particularly in Medicare. My current research focus is access to high-cost glucose-lowering drugs.
  </p>
  <p>
    I previously worked with the Duke University Margolis Center for Health Policy with a focus on coverage, payment, and competition issues around high-cost biologic drugs and cell and gene therapies. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics and Philosophy from Swarthmore College.
