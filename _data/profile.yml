  <p>
    I am a researcher in the fourth year of my PhD in Health Services Research and Health Policy with a concentration in Health Economics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am interested in access to high-cost prescription drugs, particularly in Medicare. My current research focuses on access to cardioprotective glucose-lowering drugs for the treatment of diabetes.

  <p>
    I previously worked with the Duke University Margolis Center for Health Policy on issues impacting access to biologics and cell and gene therapies. I received my bachelor’s degree in Economics and Philosophy from Swarthmore College.
